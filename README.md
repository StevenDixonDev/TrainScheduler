## Libraries

- JQuery
- FireBase, App, DataBase

## Goals

Normal: 

- When adding trains (Train Name, Destination, First Train Time, Frequency in minutes)
- App should calculate when the next train will arrive, relative to current time.
- Styling and theme are completely up to you. 

Bonus:

- Update Minutes to arrival and next train time every minute.
- Add Update and Remove Buttons for each train. 
- Make it to where only users who log into the site with google or github can edit.

## Things I want to do

- Multi - Langauge support (switch between ENG/JAP) 

## Things I learned

- I had to do a ton of research on the Shinkansen to figure out how the schedules worked
